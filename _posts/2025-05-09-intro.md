# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

Welcome to my very first GitHub Page!

I'm just getting started with **web development** and learning how to use **GitHub**. This page is part of my journey into the world of coding.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Doing

- Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Exploring Git and GitHub basics
- Building small practice projects

## ðŸ“Œ Why This Page Exists

This page is my sandboxâ€”somewhere I can practice, share my progress, and maybe even help others who are starting out too.

## ðŸš€ What's Next?

I'll keep updating this page as I learn more. Expect beginner-friendly content, projects, and maybe a few mistakes along the way (learning is messy!).

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ™Œ
